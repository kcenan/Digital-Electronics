There ara two team project in repo.

First project is written and designed with Verilog, LTSpice, MagicVLSI Layout Tool. I designed an inverter in Inverter and to prove its functionality I send clock-like signal from 0 to 1.8V with Verilog. MagicVLSI Layout Tool let me design the inverter. The layout consists of polysilicon(poly), metal1(m1), nwell,p-diffusion layer(pdiff),pwell,n-diffusion layer,p-d contact(pdc),n-d contact(ndc),n-substract contact,p-substract contact.

Second project hosts group project, the aim is to build a standard cell library which consists of INV1X, INV2X, INV4X, INV8X, XOR, XNOR, NAND2X1, NAND3X1, NOR2X1, NOR3X1, transmission gate, MUX2X1, DFF. Each section of the report describes a cell with its, transistor sizes, magic layout, functional simulation, rise/fall time simulations, schematic, symbol, and its simulation in LTSPICE.
